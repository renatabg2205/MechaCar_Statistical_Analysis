## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
<ul>
<li>Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
<br>
<li>The p-value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the significance level (assuming a significance level of 0.05%). Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.
<br>
<li>The multiple r-squared value is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of all predictions will be correct when using this linear model and each dependent value will not be determined by random chance and error.
<br>
<li>The adjusted r-squared value is 0.68, which means that roughly 68% of all predictions will be correct when using this linear model and each dependent value will not be determined by random chance and error.
<br>
<li>Based on these results, we can say that this linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes. 
</ul>
